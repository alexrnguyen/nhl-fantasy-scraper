# nhl-fantasy-scraper

A data scraper that extracts fantasy hockey rankings from NHL.com and ESPN into a spreadsheet. Using the extracted rankings, the program calculates each player's average ranking and writes a sheet containing each player's average ranking. Built using Python, Selenium, and XlsxWriter.

## Sample Spreadsheet

An example of the spreadsheet generated by the data scraper is included as an Excel file named nhl-fantasy-rankings-2023.xlsx. Alternatively, a link to a Google Sheets version of the same spreadsheet can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q6Y7awE1mJHTnA3Y-zH3Ev7yHEvHNYV0524eykKdXIU/edit?usp=sharing)
